        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
          I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University, passionate about building meaningful, user-centered applications. My academic foundation is paired with hands-on experience from hackathons and personal projects, where I’ve learned to thrive in both collaborative and self-driven environments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
          I’ve been spending a lot of time learning modern web development tools like React and Vite. I'm especially interested in building things that are intuitive, responsive, and actually enjoyable to use. Every project I work on teaches me something new — whether it’s about code, design, or just how to solve problems better.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
          Outside of tech, I’m someone who values balance. I spend my time playing volleyball, gaming with friends, and creating digital art. These hobbies help me stay creative, collaborative, and always curious.
